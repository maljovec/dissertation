This is my actual WIP dissertation.

The easiest way to compile this thesis on any Unix platform is to simply type

	make

That runs the rough equivalent of these commands:

	pdflatex thesis.ltx
	bibtex thesis
	fgrep -v fsfname thesis.idx | makeindex -c -s thesis.ist > thesis.ind
	fgrep bioname thesis.idx | fgrep -v '|see' | makeindex -c -s thesis.ist > thesis-bioname.ind
	fgrep fsfname thesis.idx | fgrep -v '|see' | makeindex -c -s thesis.ist > thesis-fsfname.ind

Repeat them FOUR (4) times to achieve consistency.

If there are no indexes, then repeat just the first two commands four
times.

During the writing process, the fastest update is done by

	make pdf-pass

It runs pdflatex, bibtex, and makeindex just once.  If the
bibliography and index are already stable, then only pdflatex needs to
be run:

	pdflatex thesis.ltx
