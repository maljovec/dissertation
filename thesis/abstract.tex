Researchers on the forefront of many scientific fields rely on experimentation and simulation to better understand phenomena occurring in nature and society.
%
The goal of such research is typically to understand the effect of one or more stimuli on the condition under study.
%
The number of effective ``stimuli,'' or inputs, can vary from a single parameter to hundreds of parameters in modern-day experiments.
%
It is therefore important to identify the most crucial ones and to also understand the behavior of the input space in an efficient and reliable manner, because obtaining data under such circumstances can be expensive, dangerous, difficult, and/or time-consuming.
%
To this end, researchers have developed effective sampling strategies, uncertainty quantification techniques, regression models, and sensitivity analyses rooted in the foundations of  probability, statistics, and geometry.
%
All these methods are aimed at providing the most knowledge from the least amount of information under the given constraints.

In this work, we explore injecting foundations from the fields of topology and visualization into each of these processes to improve the scientist's intuition and understanding of the data being collected.
%
Specifically, this document focuses on methods that treat multidimensional, numeric data as a scalar function, that is a fixed, arbitrary number of inputs describing a single output value of interest.
%
The term multidimensional is used to convey input spaces of dimensionality larger than the two or three dimensions typically used in visualization.
%
In this way, we are able to synthesize ideas from computational geometry/topology, regression analysis, data mining, and visualization in order to facilitate low-level tasks such as identifying parameters or regions of interest within the input space, choosing informative samples, summarizing trends in the data, and validating models with ground-truth datasets.
%
The techniques provided are demonstrated on applications arising from the field of nuclear engineering.
